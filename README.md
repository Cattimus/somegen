# somegen

### what is it?:
Somegen is a sister tool to [somecheck](https://github.com/Cattimus/somecheck) that I created to be able to provide checksum hashes for all of my uploaded files from this point forward. It takes a single argument which is a file name or file path. The tool will then generate hashes for the most common checksum cryptographic hashes. The idea of providing all of these is that it's likely you have at least one of these built into your OS and can verify the checksum using that.

This is a personal project and it's not intended to be production-ready. The documentation will be fairly light as I'm mostly maintaining this tool for my own use.
